\chapter{Syntax parameters}

Syntax parameter are a mechanism for rebinding a macro definition with the dynamic extent of a macro expansion. With syntax parameter instead of introducing the unhygienic binding each time, instead create binding for the keyword, which we can then adjust later when we want the keyword to have different meaning, as no new binding is introduced so hygiene is preserved, this is similar to dynamic binding mechanism we have at run time, except that the dynamic binding only occurs during macro expansion.
