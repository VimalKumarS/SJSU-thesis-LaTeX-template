Lisp and Scheme have demonstrated the power of macros to enable programmers to evolve and craft languages. Mozilla Sweet.JS provides a way for developers to enrich their JavaScript code by adding new syntax to the language through the use of macros. Sweet.JS provides the possibility to define hygienic macros inspired by Scheme. In this paper I present the implementation of a ``syntax parameter'' feature to Sweet.JS library. Syntax parameter is a mechanism for rebinding a macro definition within the dynamic context of a macro expansion. In my implementation I define the ``syntaxparam,'' which defines and binds the syntax parameter part of the compiler; ``syntaxLocalValue,'' which pull the syntax parameter definition in the defined scope and ``replaceSyntaxParamTransform,'' which expand the syntax parameter macro definition defined within the macro body using ``syntaxLocalValue''.
