Macros have a long history in computing, Mozilla Sweet.js provides a way for developer to enrich the JavaScript by adding new syntax to the language through the use of macro. Sweet.js provide the possibility to define the hygienic macros inspired by Scheme. In this paper I present the implementation of the Syntax-Parameter feature to SweetJS library. Syntax parameter is a mechanism for rebinding a macro definition within the dynamic extent of a macro expansion. In implementation I defined the ``syntaxparam'' which define and bind the syntax parameter part of the compiler, ``syntaxLocalValue'' which pull the syntax parameter definition in the defined scope and ``replaceSyntaxParamTransform'' which transform to the identifier within the macro body using syntaxLocalValue.
