\section{Sweet.JS macro system?}

Sweet.JS~\cite{bib6} is a hygienic macro compiler for JavaScript that takes JavaScript macros and produces normal JavaScript code which one can run in a browser or using a standalone interpreter like Node.JS. The idea is that you define a macro with a name and a list of patterns. Whenever a macro is invoked, the code is matched and expanded at  compile time.

Sweet.JS provides two ways to define a macro: 1) simple pattern based \textit{rule} macros that work by matching a syntax pattern and generating the new pattern based on the template, 2) the more powerful procedural \textit{case} macros allow you to manipulate syntax. The following example shows a rule based macro definition and usage:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
macro define {
   	 rule { $x } => {
   		    var $x
   	 }
   	 rule { $x = $expr } => {
   	     var $x = $expr
    	}
}
define y;
define y = 5;
\end{lstlisting}

Above code will expand to
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
	var y;
	var y = 5;
\end{lstlisting}
